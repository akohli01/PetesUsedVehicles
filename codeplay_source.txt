// Fiddling around with PHP. I decided to use various fundamental PHP topics that I know about.

echo "&lt;h2> Hello everyone, my name is Amit Kohli. Today we will be fiddling around with some PHP. &lt;/h2>;" ;


//Work with variables

echo "&lt;h4>First let us look at variables in PHP... &lt;/h4>";

echo "PHP variables are identified using the '$' sign and can hold various data types including numbers, strings , and booleans &lt;br>";

echo "&lt;h4>Let's look at a few examples...&lt;/h4>";


//Create various variables

$integer = 5;

echo 'Hi, I am a variable named $integer and my value is ' .  $integer. ".&lt;br>";

$string = "Good luck";

echo 'Hi, I am a variable named $string and my value is '.  "'$string'". ".&lt;br>";

$boolean = true;

echo 'Hi, I am a variable named $boolean and my value is '.  $boolean ."&lt;br>";


//Work with arrays

echo "&lt;h4>Now we shall look at arrays...&lt;/h4>";

echo "Arrays are used to multiple (usually homogeneous) values in a single variable. &lt;br>&lt;br>";


//Create an array to store names 

$names = ["Sam", "Bill", "George"];

echo "A sample array has been created.. &lt;br>";

echo 'Hi, I am an array called $names. I have '. count($names). ' names which are &lt;br>';

foreach ($names as $name) {
    echo $name. '&lt;br>';
}


//Work with functions

echo "&lt;h4> Now let's work with functions... &lt;/h4>";

echo "Functions are basically reusable 'actions'.&lt;br>";

echo "Functions allow you to write code that can accept values, modify them, and then return the result if needed.&lt;br>&lt;br>";

//Create a function to add two numbers

function addNumbers($num1, $num2){
return "The sum is " .($num1 + $num2);
}

echo "A function to add two numbers has been created. Now let us pass in two numbers. The numbers are 5 and 10.&lt;br>... ";

echo addNumbers(5,10);


//Types of functions

echo "&lt;br>&lt;br>There are two basic types of functions: predefined and user-defined.";

echo"&lt;br>Predefined functions come in different categories such as string or numeric functions";

echo "&lt;br> An example would be a function to count the number of characters in a string";

echo '&lt;br>&lt;br>A variable called $string contains the words "Good luck".';

echo 'The number of charaters in $string is '. strlen($string);


//Work with conditionals

echo "&lt;h4>Now let's us work with conditional statements&lt;/h4>";

echo "Sometimes we want to make decisions in our code. To do that we use if and else statements.&lt;br>&lt;br>";

echo "Let's us compare two numbers and display the number that is greater.&lt;br>";

echo 'The numbers are 5 (located in $num1) and 10 (located in $num2)&lt;br>';

$num1 = 5;
$num2 = 10;

if ($num1 > $num2)
echo $num1. " is greater than ". $num2;

else 
echo $num2. " is greater than ". $num1;


//Various Practice

echo "&lt;h4>Now let's practice some basic math! ......&lt;/h4>";

echo '5+6 = '. (5+6). "&lt;br>";

echo '5*6 = '. (5*6). "&lt;br>";

echo '50/10 = '. (50/10). "&lt;br>";

echo '50-7 = '. (50-7). "&lt;br>";
