            <p><b> Overview: </b> Since 1960, Pete's Used Vehicles has only sold vehicles that are in great condition (e.g.
                vehicles which are not involved in accidents).
                In addition, we buy used vehicles*. Our employees are highly qualified and are dedicated to providing
                customer satisfaction. We also
                offer an extended warranty with "no strings attached". Our "Fast-and-Easy" financing process helps you
                obtain a loan without much hassle**. "Fast-and-Easy"
                financing is made possible through partnerships with Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citibank. Our primary
                location is in Frankfurt, Germany,
                but we were able to obtain another car lot on the outskirts of Manhattan, New York.
            </p>
