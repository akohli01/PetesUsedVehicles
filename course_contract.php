            <p>I, Amit Kohli agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2018, WEB 250 - Database-driven Websites
                course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information
                there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in
                assignments may show as absences. </p>

            <p>Signed: Amit Kohli, January 14th, 2018</p>
